This blog introduces the basics of Git workflow, and how to use it for source code management. Put it simply, Git enables version control between multiple programmers to work locally and update via a shared codebase like GitHub.

## Simple Git Workflow

Figure below shows a simple workflow for using Git to maintain a repository. ***Working directory*** is the local folder that each programmer works on, such as adding or removing some files.  ***Staging area*** places all the changes to be commited next. ***Local Repo (HEAD)*** is the repository stored on the local machine, and ***Remote Repo (MASTER)*** is the repository stored on the remote side.

## Basic Git Commands

### Initialize Local Repository

```ruby
git clone remote_repository_URL # Download from a remote repository, and place a copy to local directory
git init # Initiate an empty git repository
```

### Add Files to the Staging Area for Commit

```ruby
git add . # Stage all the files in local repo to commit area
git add README.md # Stage READMD.md to commit area
git status # Lists all new or modified files to be committed
```

### Commit/Uncommit Changes to Local Repo

```ruby
git commit -m "Commit Message" # Commit Message describes current commit to all other users
```

Suppose you just discovered that your last commit has some error or some unwanted files, do the following to unstage the files:

```ruby
git reset HEAD~1 # Remove the most recent commit
```

### Add a Remote Origin and Push

Up till now, all changes we made in the file are updated in local repository. To update the changes to the remote master. Do the following:

```ruby
git remote add origin remote_repository_URL # Set the new remote
git remote -v # list the remote connections you have to other repositories
git push -u origin master # Push changes to origin
```

### Examine the Changes Made to File

To examine the changes made on the files, do the following:

```ruby
git diff # Show the file changes not yet staged
```

### Revert Back to Last Committed Version

```ruby
git checkout . 
git checkout -- <filename> # Revert back to a specific file name
git log # See commit history made to the files
```

### Git Fetch, Git Merge

In simplest terms, `git fecth` followed by `git merge` equals to `git pull`.

`git pull` automatically merges the commits into the working branch without reviewing them first. `git fetch` gathers all commits that do not exist in current branch from target branch and stores in local repository, but does not merge them with current branch, allowing further examining on local and remote files before `git merge`.
